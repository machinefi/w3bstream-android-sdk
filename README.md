# W3bstream Android SDK

The W3bstream Android SDK is a framework that enables connecting data generated by devices and machines in the physical world to the blockchain world using the IoTeX blockchain. W3bStream uses a network of decentralized gateways (W3bStream nodes) to stream encrypted data from IoT devices and machines and create proofs of real-world events on different blockchains. For documentation and APIs, please visit the project [website](https://mainnet.w3bstream.com/).
